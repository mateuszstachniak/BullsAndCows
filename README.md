# Bulls And Cows Game

## Starting up

Program works in command line. Made in Java 17.

## Assumption

After final stage of JetBrains Academy project I spend some time to improve my pseudoRandomGenerator(). Now it's fully working :). Also made some major rework of code to make it more clean and readable. <br><br>


Game asks user for the length of the secret word, and for the range of possible characters in the secret code (both 36 max).

Generates a secret code using numbers and characters from user range. Game also prints the secret code using '*' character and print which characters were used to generate the secret code.

Game takes user input and compares it with a secret word. It gives advices which numbers are in good positions (bulls), or appears in a secret word (cows).
