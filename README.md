# Bulls And Cows Game

# Assumption

After final stage of JetBrains Academy project. \
\
Game is almost finished. I need to change the pseudoRandomGenerator(). For now it takes too long to generate secret word with inputs bigger than n=29 when m=36.

In other cases game is fully working:

Asks for the length of the secret word (36 max).

Asks for the range of possible characters in the secret code (36 possible).

Generates a secret code using numbers and characters from user range. Game also prints the secret code using '*' character and print which characters were used to generate the secret code.

Game takes user input and compares it with a secret word. It gives advices which numbers are in good positions, or appers in a secret word.

Working as a (fully) playable game, and handels all expected errors coused by wrong user inputs.
